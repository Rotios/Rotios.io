                    Logs are an integral part of any software. They provide valuable runtime information about your system, its active sessions,
                    its state, and so much more. Learning how to correctly log a software's actions is one of the most important life skills
                    all software engineers should master. With the advent of the cloud and microservices, logging has become even more 
                    integral towards ensuring proper application behaviour. With hundreds or even thousands of microservices active on the cloud 
                    at any given time, knowing which logs belong to an application and how each reacts to the same input is necessary to ensure
                    consistent and correct behaviour.
