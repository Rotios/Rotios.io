                    Logs are an integral part of any software. They provide valuable runtime information about our systems, their active sessions,
                    their state, and so much more. Learning how to correctly log a software's actions is one of the most important life skills
                    all software engineers should master, and with the advent of the cloud and microservices, it has become that much more necessary.

                    For this article, I will assume that you know about microservice architectures, have a passing knowledge of AWS infrastructure, and 
                    have developed (or are developing) a Java SpringBoot application with either Log4J2 or Logback as your Logging Framework.
